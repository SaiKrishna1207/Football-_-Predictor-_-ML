# Spanish_League_Predictions
This is a work of my predictions of spanish league football matches. The dataset contains all matches' scorelines from 1970 to 2018.
The columns of the data are : (1) Season, (2) Matchday Round, (3) Home team, (4) Away team, (5)Goals by Home team, (6)Goals by away team, (7) Date of the game, (8) Timestamp.

The initial commit made was just a rough model using the Random Forest Regressor.
The output is the predicted scoreline of the matches.
